# ReviewingNYAirbnbData
The project uses both insights from the regression analysis and the detailed dashboard to provide and display a thorough understanding of pricing dynamics, review sentiment and key factors that affect Airbnb listings in New York.

The 'listings New York.csv' file contains all the metadata in the form of different variables. The 'Aggregate_sentiment_reviews' contains the average sentiment expressed by guests for each of the airbnb listings, which lies between -1 to 1 (closer to 1 means strong positive sentiment and closer to -1 means strong negative sentiment).

The 2 csv files were cleaned, sorted, transformed then merged into a 'merged_df' through the use of PowerBI. A dashboard was created to highlight the most important indicators of the airbnb business. A predictive model was developed to predict 'reviews_per_month' using relevant variables through analysis. The model results were then interperted with future recommendations.
